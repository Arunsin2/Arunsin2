    "1. EXPLAIN with an example each when to use a for loop and while loop?\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Loop:\n",
    "Use a for loop when you know the number of iterations in advance, such as when iterating over elements in a list or performing a fixed number of repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop\n",
    "for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "in this example, the loop will iterate exactly 5 times, printing numbers from 1 to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Loop:\n",
    "Use a while loop when you need to iterate until a certain condition is met, and the number of iterations is not known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Countdown from 5 to 1 using a while loop\n",
    "count = 5\n",
    "while count > 0:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count -= 1\n",
    "In this example, the loop will continue until the count variable becomes 0. The number of iterations depends on the initial value of count.\n",
